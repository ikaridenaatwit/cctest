Creates a text for the user to enter an input text by creating a variable names any pizza by inputting ?pizza=Pepperoni after /PizzaQuestion. This has to be only a string though nothing else.

This webpage asks what type of pizza would you like. If you type in specific answers such as "Pepperoni", "Cheese", and "Pineapple"; it would have a specific response to that question. This can be done as previously doing ?pizza=Pepperoni.

The next webpage asks the user for toppings and it is as before on the previous webpage but instead of using the variable pizza you have to use another variable called toppings. There will be specific responses based on what type of string you inserted. If you type in "Olives", "Beef", or "Chicken" ; the webpage will respond by saying it has it and will cook one right up. If you put anything else, it will respond by saying it does not have that specific topping.

Put a number by doing ?tablenumber = 0. The value must be greater than or equal to zero otherwise it will say Internal Server Error.
